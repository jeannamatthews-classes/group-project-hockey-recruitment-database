I don't think there has been significant changes since the last trajectory update. As part of the frontend, we have been meeting
and advancing. We have mostly still been learning about Vue, so we can advance quicker once we have a better understanding, and 
we realize that we need to meet frequently and learn fast (putting in extra work) in this upcoming week, considering that RAPS 
is coming. As for the backend, I believe things are somewhat on pace since they wanted to keep the Gantt Chart pretty much the same, 
but I'm not 100% sure where they stand. Once they finish the backend, they'll be joining the frontend to try and speed up the process
so I think we will be fine in the long run. The goal right now is getting as much as possible ready for RAPS so we have something nice
to present.
