We would say that the project timeline is slipping unfortunately. There has been some progress on the backend, but the frontend still 
hasnâ€™t progressed. The frontend team is planning on meeting tomorrow to make some progress, and we plan on stepping up the progress a 
lot moving forward. We are hoping that with a lot of hard work we will be able to still achieve more than the MVP, but right now the 
goal is to get to the offline functionality portion as soon as possible so we can cross out that key risk.
