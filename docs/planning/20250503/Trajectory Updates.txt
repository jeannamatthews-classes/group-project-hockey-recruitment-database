We were able to produce a near functional MVP. While the project has many bugs and might not be fully ready to be used in production, it is in a workable state that could be made into a finished product by a future maintainer.
At the moment, no one has expressed interest in maintaining the project going forwards. We have created a maintenance plan suggestion, for the consideration of anyone interested in adding new features or maintaining the project going forwards.
