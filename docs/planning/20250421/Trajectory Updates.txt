There should have been an earlier update, but this will serve as a little overview of everything. In terms of RAPS, we think it went really
well. Since then, we have made pretty significant pushes in terms of backend integration to the frontend, where we can run everything
together with 1 command only. We now need to make some updates on the frontend still and start connecting the database to the webpages,
as well as try and get offline functionality to work once we have that. With a little over 2 weeks left, I think we are doing okay if we
keep working hard. Personally (Mark), I am now mostly done with other work so I will be working on this for more hours, and I am assuming
the rest might feel the same way.
