I didn't really do much at all for the design document, my teammates did a great job. Some of them had a lot more knowledge of what it would look like, and since we 
didn't meet, I wasn't able to give much feedback. I will be putting more work over the time of the project, just these beginning tasks were a little harder for me 
to get involved. However, I was still very active in our groupchat.

    3/13        20 minutes  Did some research on frontend frameworks and chose which one will be used in our project. Added it to the design document with reasons why.
    3/14        1 hour      Created all of the necessary directories and files for the assignment. Finished my part of the homework.

Total: 1 hour and 20 minutes
