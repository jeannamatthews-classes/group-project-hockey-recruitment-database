TIMELOG

I am assuming that I am not to include the time spent on individual assignments or anything of that sort. Moving forward, I will have a good system of keeping track of 
my time spent per task, but for now this will be a rough estimate without exact dates. First, I was the one that submitted the registration for RAPS. 
Although this could have been quicker if I just copied the very short description we had of the project for the abstract, I decided to actually write something 
meaningful and somewhat close to the 350 word mark. I ended up spending around 45 minutes or a little less on this assignment. In terms of the GANTT chart and 
Identification of Key Risks Completion requirements document, we all worked on this together during class. I was the one that created the repository and the 
Gantt Chart, as we are using it on GitHub. We weren't able to fully finish that document in the 1 hour and 15 minute timeline, so some group members formatted 
everything correctly at the end. In terms of that formatting the only thing I did was add the explanation of why out Gantt chart was not very well developed. 
The warm-up group assignment on GitHub likely took me around half an hour at first, and some extra time checking that everyone did their part (although we still
lost some points anyway). I'm not sure if the Gantt Chart Forum counts for this so I will not be including it. In terms of proposing the design document contents 
and format, I did not contribute to it. We ended up not meeting on Thursday the 6th, so other group members that worked on the user requirements of this project
did it on their own time and left it to other group members to review. I did not find any flaws so I didn't add anything. That was it up to 3/11/2025 for the group 
project.

Total time: 2 hours and 45 minutes

I didn't really do much at all for the design document, my teammates did a great job. Some of them had a lot more knowledge of what it would look like, and since we 
didn't meet, I wasn't able to give much feedback. I will be putting more work over the time of the project, just these beginning tasks were a little harder for me 
to get involved. However, I was still very active in our groupchat.
