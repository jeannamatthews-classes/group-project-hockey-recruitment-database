TIMELOG

I am assuming that I am not to include the time spent on individual assignments or anything of that sort. Moving forward, I will have a good system of keeping track of 
my time spent per task, but for now this will be a rough estimate without exact dates. First, I was the one that submitted the registration for RAPS. 
Although this could have been quicker if I just copied the very short description we had of the project for the abstract, I decided to actually write something 
meaningful and somewhat close to the 350 word mark. I ended up spending around 45 minutes or a little less on this assignment. In terms of the GANTT chart and 
Identification of Key Risks Completion requirements document, we all worked on this together during class. I was the one that created the repository and the 
Gantt Chart, as we are using it on GitHub. We weren't able to fully finish that document in the 1 hour and 15 minute timeline, so some group members formatted 
everything correctly at the end. In terms of that formatting the only thing I did was add the explanation of why out Gantt chart was not very well developed. 
The warm-up group assignment on GitHub likely took me around half an hour at first, and some extra time checking that everyone did their part (although we still
lost some points anyway). I'm not sure if the Gantt Chart Forum counts for this so I will not be including it. In terms of proposing the design document contents 
and format, I did not contribute to it. We ended up not meeting on Thursday the 6th, so other group members that worked on the user requirements of this project
did it on their own time and left it to other group members to review. I did not find any flaws so I didn't add anything. That was it up to 3/11/2025 for the group 
project.

Total time: 2 hours and 45 minutes

I didn't really do much at all for the design document, my teammates did a great job. Some of them had a lot more knowledge of what it would look like, and since we 
didn't meet, I wasn't able to give much feedback. I will be putting more work over the time of the project, just these beginning tasks were a little harder for me 
to get involved. However, I was still very active in our groupchat.

DATE        TIME        TASKS
3/13        30 minutes  Did some research on frontend frameworks and chose which one will be used in our project. Added it to the design document with reasons why.
3/14        60 minutes  Created all of the necessary directories and files for the assignment. Finished my part of the homework.
3/27        75 minutes  Group meeting where we updated the GANTT chart and figured out how to get some meaningful progress done.
3/28        30 minutes  Finished all necessary adjustments before Friday 3/28 5 PM deadline.
3/31        30 minutes  Spent time checking everything else that needs to be done and figuring out exactly where we are in our progress and adding a narrative about it.
4/1         75 minutes  Met with the frontend group. We spent the bulk of our time figuring out how to include Vue in our project, and were then able to add it to a 
                        restructure branch in order to not mess up the Django bootstrapping on accident. We also agreed on spending time learning Vue so we know exactly 
                        where to include what files and how the files are structured when using Vue. We also agreed that we have to move forward fast at this point in time.
4/3         15 minutes  Updating timelog 
4/3         60 minutes  Started watching the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeNfHj6MhgA so I can learn Vue, but there are some prerequesites that I needed to work on
                        before that, so I decided to start recapping HTML and CSS, learning JavaScript, Events and DOM Manipulation, Fetch API and Basic HTTP, Arrow functions, 
                        and NPM so I can actually understand Vue. I started with the YouTube series https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8BoXcpCUvdmdPZFuR5y2lV,
                        where I have around 10 minutes left to watch and then will hop into a CSS overview and keep going.
4/3         75 minutes  The following playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH-cEDOofOujFIknfZZpIk3a&si=64eJ7XSbJylrpW1t includes CSS and JavaScript as well so
                        I will be following that. I ended up finishing the HTML and watched the whole video about CSS, but now there are a couple of videos about actually 
                        putting it into practice. We also met as a group, where Kristi and I updated the Gantt chart and discussed how we plan on meeting again soon once the
                        both of us have a better understanding of Vue.
4/3         15 minutes  Writing the narrative for this week and the gantt chart to the github repository.
