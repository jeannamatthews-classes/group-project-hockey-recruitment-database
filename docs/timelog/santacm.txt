TIMELOG

High-Level Summary before 3/11:
I am assuming that I am not to include the time spent on individual assignments or anything of that sort. Moving forward, I will have a good system of keeping track of 
my time spent per task, but for now this will be a rough estimate without exact dates. First, I was the one that submitted the registration for RAPS. 
Although this could have been quicker if I just copied the very short description we had of the project for the abstract, I decided to actually write something 
meaningful and somewhat close to the 350 word mark. I ended up spending around 45 minutes or a little less on this assignment. In terms of the GANTT chart and 
Identification of Key Risks Completion requirements document, we all worked on this together during class. I was the one that created the repository and the 
Gantt Chart, as we are using it on GitHub. We weren't able to fully finish that document in the 1 hour and 15 minute timeline, so some group members formatted 
everything correctly at the end. In terms of that formatting the only thing I did was add the explanation of why out Gantt chart was not very well developed. 
The warm-up group assignment on GitHub likely took me around half an hour at first, and some extra time checking that everyone did their part (although we still
lost some points anyway). I'm not sure if the Gantt Chart Forum counts for this so I will not be including it. In terms of proposing the design document contents 
and format, I did not contribute to it. We ended up not meeting on Thursday the 6th, so other group members that worked on the user requirements of this project
did it on their own time and left it to other group members to review. I did not find any flaws so I didn't add anything. That was it up to 3/11/2025 for the group 
project.

Total time: 2 hours and 45 minutes

I didn't really do much at all for the design document, my teammates did a great job. Some of them had a lot more knowledge of what it would look like, and since we 
didn't meet, I wasn't able to give much feedback. I will be putting more work over the time of the project, just these beginning tasks were a little harder for me 
to get involved. However, I was still very active in our groupchat.

DATE        TIME            TASKS
3/13        30 minutes      Did some research on frontend frameworks and chose which one will be used in our project. Added it to the design document with reasons why.
3/14        60 minutes      Created all of the necessary directories and files for the assignment. Finished my part of the homework.
3/27        75 minutes      Group meeting where we updated the GANTT chart and figured out how to get some meaningful progress done.
3/28        30 minutes      Finished all necessary adjustments before Friday 3/28 5 PM deadline.
3/31        30 minutes      Spent time checking everything else that needs to be done and figuring out exactly where we are in our progress and adding a narrative about it.
4/1         75 minutes      Met with the frontend group. We spent the bulk of our time figuring out how to include Vue in our project, and were then able to add it to a 
                            restructure branch in order to not mess up the Django bootstrapping on accident. We also agreed on spending time learning Vue so we know exactly 
                            where to include what files and how the files are structured when using Vue. We also agreed that we have to move forward fast at this point in time.
4/3         15 minutes      Updating timelog 
4/3         60 minutes      Started watching the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeNfHj6MhgA so I can learn Vue, but there are some prerequesites that I needed to work on
                            before that, so I decided to start recapping HTML and CSS, learning JavaScript, Events and DOM Manipulation, Fetch API and Basic HTTP, Arrow functions, 
                            and NPM so I can actually understand Vue. I started with the YouTube series https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8BoXcpCUvdmdPZFuR5y2lV,
                            where I have around 10 minutes left to watch and then will hop into a CSS overview and keep going.
4/3         75 minutes      The following playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH-cEDOofOujFIknfZZpIk3a&si=64eJ7XSbJylrpW1t includes CSS and JavaScript as well so
                            I will be following that. I ended up finishing the HTML and watched the whole video about CSS, but now there are a couple of videos about actually 
                            putting it into practice. We also met as a group, where Kristi and I updated the Gantt chart and discussed how we plan on meeting again soon once the
                            both of us have a better understanding of Vue.
4/3         15 minutes      Writing the narrative for this week and the gantt chart to the github repository.
4/9         90 minutes      Finished watching the series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH-cEDOofOujFIknfZZpIk3a. I watched it in 1.5x speed, so that's why I was 
                            able to finish it quicker. This gave me a much better understanding of CSS and Javascript so I can actually get moving to Vue.js. 
4/9         60 minutes      Watched the first 3 videos about Vue.js: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1. This gave me a good understanding of
                            important topics such as v-if so I can make tabs and all of that.
4/10        150 minutes     Spent this time before class working on player-info-view, which is shown in the commit in the restructure branch. I only made the commit on 4/17,
                            which is a big problem that could have been avoided. I should have pushed it earlier and that is my fault, I forgot it wasn't pushed. I included the
                            page that comes from the code in the slides used for RAPS, hopefully that's okay, I apologize. In terms of actual work here, The html was mostly simple,
                            there wasn't anything crazy. I had never done anything with a data table, so I had to get used to that, but besides that there wasn't anything too hard.
                            In terms of css, I was able to pick up on some stuff done by my other group members, combined with searching up for some templates online and using
                            DeepSeek for some pointers and tips to make it look good and more similar to Clarkson colors and all while looking good. The JavaScript also wasn't too
                            bad, it just took me some time since I don't really have much experience in any of this. Moving forward, my group and I realized that it's probably better
                            to have some more general CSS in main.css that applies to all pages, so that is going to be one of the next things I will be working on in order to make
                            things more organized and modular.                                                                                                     
4/10        75 minutes      Group meeting, where we mostly discussed details about the presentation, while also changing some details on the Gantt Chart and planning out how to
                            advance. The focus was definitely RAPS, though.
4/10        30 minutes      Changing up the slides I was going to present at RAPS and preparing my speech so I actually do a good job during RAPS.
4/11        15/105 minutes  I'm not sure what to count for my timelog. I was there for the entirety of the presentations, but at the same time that feels very optional. But yeah,
                            this is just the time spent at RAPS.
4/17        45 minutes      Pushed my progress to GitHub (again, I apologize), and added everything to the timelog, which took a decent amount of time to explain.
4/17        75 minutes      Team meeting. We discussed how we'll be connecting the backend to the frontend so we can get a website that is not just a placeholder.
                            The frontend decided what we're each going to working on. I will be working on making a global css, adding the video tab to my page, and
                            whatever else I have time for. We also talked about the demo and how we're going to approach it moving forward. Also updated the Gantt Chartt.
4/21        15 minutes      Updated the planning folder.
4/21        75 minutes      Tried to figure out how to run the program on my computer, as we integrated django into things which forced me to get docker desktop and all this other 
                            stuff instead of just running npm run dev inside the vue app folder. Encountered some issues that were then solved in the meeting. The rest of the time before
                            the meeting I ended up working on the global css, even though a little blindly. I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out how to organize it, but I got
                            some progress done which I will use if we have time to moving forward after I finish some more important tasks first.
4/21        90 minutes      Team meeting. We discussed where we were at in terms of progress and how we were going to go about the presentation. They helped me figure out how to running
                            things on my computer. I was tasked with the rest of the frontend to integrate the backend with API calls and all of that.
4/21        ~105 minutes    The reason I am using a tilda is because it was sort of broken apart the time of me working. I would say the time I spent confused on how the hell to do
                            what we were supposed to do as the frontend was around 105 minutes. In this time, I did a lot of searching to learn how to incorporate the 2, and what even is
                            a service worker, which was something that we would need to implement at some point. This was the point where I felt like simply the things we are working on
                            are a bit too advanced for my level of web development at the moment and that's why the time was a bit broken apart, as I kind of gave up a couple of times 
                            and came back. Krist and I talked a bit about how we were struggling and trying to find a solution to the problem throughout the night. Since there was time 
                            pressure (the day after) to finish stuff for the demo, I was sort of trying stuff without knowing enough about Vue and it was obvious I wasn't knowledgeable
                            enough. Luckily, Kristi was able to make some nice progress, but that's when I decided to just spend time watching more of that video series, as part 9 was 
                            pretty related to what I needed to do.
4/21        90 minutes      I reviewed the first 3 parts of the playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1, and then watched 2 more, this time not
                            sped up as I was already pretty tired. All of that adds up to 90 minutes.
4/22        15 minutes      For now I'm not going to count class time for the presentation as time, but this is when we presented. The group met right before the presentation but I wasn'tab
                            able to until 15 minutes before, where we sort of reviewed what we were going to be doing.
4/27        30 minutes      Writing this long time log, reviewing my tasks, and checking the gantt chart. I ended up not updating it yet, but now I'll be finishing up the videos so I can
                            work better on integrating everything. I know what to do so I will do the gantt chart a little later.
4/29        210 minutes     Went back to take notes on earlier videos, and watched up until halway of the 10th video, as I noticed it wouldn't be that needed for this project. I have around 
                            6 pages that help me figure out exactly how to advance.
5/1         75 minutes      I was able to actually use real data now, which will be shown by the push to both players-view and player-info-view. I did mess up the filtering for the 
                            players_view unfortunately but I will try and fix that soon. To fetch I used the help of the videos and https://vuejs.org/examples/#fetching-data. However, I now
                            need help with the notes part, as the API is not set up correctly for that and it also doesn't facilitate the player-info-view either. Notes, is a very important 
                            part of our project, so I will be focusing on that a lot.
5/1         45 minutes      When trying to actually fetch the data from the backend, I saw that the date format was actually incorrect so I changed it, which will be reflected in the
                            next push. This website: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14202944/sqlite-select-random-datetime-in-range helped me figure out how to deal with the issue, and
                            ended up downloading DBeaver to deal with the issue and actually be able to read what the database has, where I then fixed the issue. This also took a bit because
                            I had to deal with my own issues with Docker and actually running the program.
5/1         15 minutes      Wrote this timelog.
5/1         30 minutes      Team communication of advances and figuring out how to move forward.
5/2         120 minutes     Added fetching and saving notes functionality on games-view, while fixing players-view filtering and adding saving notes functionality there as well. The API call
                            for creating notes had a bug, so I tried to debug it but turns out it was from the backend side of things. Turns out that demo_data.sql had " instead of ' so I
                            fixed that. Within this time debugging was included.
5/3         15 hours        Wasn't able to write much, but hopefully you can see the commit history as proof of everything I did. I'm so sorry for making so many last minute changes.
