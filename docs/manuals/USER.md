### Safari on iOS / iPadOS
Visit the website and hit the share button where one of the options will be "Add to Home Screen". Press this and then hit "Add". This will install the application like a normal app for offline use.
### Desktop Chrome or Chromium based (Edge, Brave, etc.)
If not prompted automatically, there should be an icon on right side of the url bar which shows some sort of download or add icon. Click this icon and follow the prompts to install the application for offline use.
### Desktop Firefox or Firefox Based (Librefox, etc.)
Currently firefox does not support progressive web apps. The application can still be used as a normal website.
